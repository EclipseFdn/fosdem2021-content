  <h2 id="eclipse-brussels">The Eclipse Foundation has moved to Brussels!</h2>

  <p>The Eclipse Foundation AISBL is now the largest Open Source Foundation in Europe, with our new home based in the heart of Brussels, Belgium. Since its establishment in January 2021, this new organization is already gathering great momentum. It is accelerating the drive to digitization throughout the EU and provides a new engine for the development of innovative and open technologies across the continent and beyond. Find out more about our move at <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/europe/">eclipse.org/europe</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="mb-3" id="ecd">Eclipse Cloud DevTools</h3>
  <a href="https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/"><img src="/stands/eclipse-foundation/logo-ecd.png" class="img img-fluid mb-3" alt="logo of Could Development Tools"></a>
  <p>
    The mission of the Eclipse Cloud DevTools Working Group is to define and build an ecosystem of best-in-class open-source web and cloud-based development tools; and to promote and drive the broad adoption of these tools.

      <p>
        Eclipse Theia is an extensible platform to develop multi-language Cloud & Desktop IDEs with state-of-the-art web technologies. Managed under the Cloud DevTools Working Group, Eclipse Theia launched Theia Blueprint, a pre-built version of Theia that can be installed natively for all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS and Linux). More recently, the <a href="https://cdt-cloud.io/">CDT.Cloud Blueprint project</a> is a template tool for building custom, web-based C/C++ tools. It is made of existing open source components and provides a typical C/C++ IDE based on the Eclipse Theia platform.

  <p>
    The Eclipse IDE is a very popular Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but we have a number of pretty cool IDEs, including our C/C++ IDE, JavaScript/TypeScript IDE, PHP IDE, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can easily combine multiple language support and other features into any of our default packages, and the Eclipse Marketplace allows for virtually unlimited customization and extension.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-0">Interested in contributing? There are a number of ways to get involved, including:</p>
  <ul>

  <h3 id="iot" class="mb-3">Eclipse IoT and Edge Computing</h3>
  <div class="row mb-3">
    <a class="col-lg-4" href="https://iot.eclipse.org/"><img src="/stands/eclipse-foundation/logo-iot.png" class="img img-fluid" alt="logo of Eclipse IoT"></a>
    <a class="col-lg-4 " href="https://edgenative.eclipse.org/"><img src="/stands/eclipse-foundation/logo-edgenative.png" class="img img-fluid" alt="logo of Edge Native Working Group"></a>
    <a class="col-lg-4" href="https://sparkplug.eclipse.org/"><img src="/stands/eclipse-foundation/logo-sparkplug.png" class="img img-fluid" alt="logo of Sparkplug Working Group"></a>
  </div>
  <p>
    The IoT and Edge Computing domain at the Eclipse Foundation is made of three distinct working groups, each with their own specific focus.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://iot.eclipse.org">Eclipse IoT</a> is a community working on open-source IoT building blocks that power the world’s leading commercial IoT solutions. It provides everything from protocol implementations (CoAP, DDS, LwM2M, MQTT) to IoT Cloud platforms able to perform constrained device management, software updates, and digital twins, among others.
  </P>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://edgenative.eclipse.org/">Edge Native Working Group</a> aims to deliver production-ready open source platforms for the development, operation, and management of Edge Native applications. It offers two distinct open-source Edge Computing platforms: <a href="https://iofog.org/">Eclipse ioFog</a> and  <a href="https://fog05.io/">Eclipse fog05</a>. It is also the home to the  <a href="https://zenoh.io/">zenoh protocol</a>, an edge native publish/subscribe protocol that integrates the notions of distributed storage, evals, and queries.
  </P>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://sparkplug.eclipse.org/">Sparkplug Working Group</a> is the steward of the Sparkplug specification. Sparkplug is an open-source protocol specification that uses MQTT as a transport. The aim of the Sparkplug protocol is to ensure Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) deployments are open and interoperable. Eclipse Sparkplug reduces complexity by using an MQTT broker as the pillar of the solution architecture, thus avoiding complicated architectures and custom connections.

  <h3 id="jakartaee" class="mb-3"">Jakarta EE</h3>
  <a href="https://jakarta.ee/"><img src="/stands/eclipse-foundation/logo-jakartaee.jpg" class="img img-fluid mb-3" alt="logo of Jakarta EE"></a>
  <p>
    For many years, Java EE has been a major platform for mission-critical enterprise applications. In order to accelerate business application development for a cloud-native world, leading software vendors collaborated to move Java EE technologies to the Eclipse Foundation where they will evolve under the Jakarta EE brand. Powered by participation, Jakarta EE is focused on enabling community-driven collaboration and open innovation for the cloud. Build modern and portable enterprise applications and protect your investments in Java EE.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 3 successful releases so far (<a href="https://jakarta.ee/release/9.1/">Jakarta EE 9.1</a>, the latest version), Jakarta EE 10 as the community-driven and first innovation release of Jakarta EE is expected in Q2, 2022. 
  </p>
  <p>

  <h3 id="oniro">Eclipse Oniro</h3>
  <a href="https://oniroproject.org/"><img src="/stands/eclipse-foundation/logo-oniro.png" class="img img-fluid" width="200px" alt="logo of Eclipse Oniro"></a>
  <p>
    <a href="https://oniroproject.org/">Oniro</a> is an Eclipse Foundation project based on the development of a distributed open source operating system, that means one single software able to talk, interconnect and relate multiple IoT and consumer devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach is opening to a new mission: avoiding technology silos through the path of building one end-to-end open source ecosystem that is able to integrate device makers, ODMs, app developers and consumers perspectives and needs all together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of Oniro is to evolve a set of builtin system capabilities on top of commodity open source kernels that allows sharing of resources and collaboration across distributed devices of various classes along with reusing and collaborating with existing open source projects (e.g. Yocto Project, Zephyr, Reuse from FSFE, etc).
  </p>
  <p class="mb-0">Interested in the project? There are multiple ways to connect with us: </p>

  <p>
    The Eclipse Foundation has been a partner in many publicly funded research projects since 2013, offering sustainability, guidance, expertise, open collaboration and access to the Eclipse Ecosystem. We help organizations to successfully create, publish, and sustain an open source software platform, making the results of the research projects available for commercial or public exploitation.
