        <p>Newly transitioned to Eclipse Foundation management, Open VSX is a vendor-neutral and publicly hosted open source alternative to the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace for VS Code extensions. It delivers on the industry’s need for a more flexible and open approach to VS Code extensions and marketplace technologies.</p>
        Interested in getting involved with Open VSX? Try:
        <ul>
        <li>Improving the code: pick an existing issue, or find things that can be improved in the frontend</li>
        <li>Being an ambassador / advocate: encourage extension developers to publish to open-vsx.org</li>
        <li>Providing integrations with existing tools / IDEs that support VS Code extensions</li>
        </ul>
        Great places to start:
